\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present an optimization-based retargeting method for
precise reproduction of captured human motions by a humanoid robot.
We take into account two important aspects of retargeting
simultaneously: spatial relationship and robot dynamics model.  The
former takes care of the spatial relationship between the body parts
based on ``interaction mesh'' to follow the human motion in a natural
manner, whereas the latter adapts the resulting motion in such a way
that the dynamic constraints such as torque limit or dynamic balance
are being satisfied.  We have integrated the interaction mesh and the
dynamic constraints in a unified optimization framework, which is
advantageous for generation of natural motions by a humanoid robot
compared to previous work that performs those processes
separately. 
We have validated the basic effectiveness of the proposed method
with a sequence of postures converted from captured human  data to a
humanoid robot.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

One of the advantages of human-size humanoid robots is
its ability to generate whole-body motions maintaining similar
dynamics to humans.
This ability allows a humanoid robot to serve as an entertainer like
a dancer of an actor \cite{nakaoka_iros2010}, or also to use various
machines and devices designed for humans \cite{Yokoi03iros}.
As an extension of the latter use, a new application
has recently been studied: a humanoid robot as an evaluator of human
assistive devices \cite{Takanishi06ICRA,Miura13ICRA}.
If a humanoid reproduces human motions faithfully, it can be used to
test the devices instead of human subjects.
This brings several benefits such as no need for ethical
process, repeated test with exactly the same motions under the same
conditions, and qualitative evaluation through sensory measurement
like torque and force.
It has been demonstrated that the human-size humanoid HRP-4C
\cite{Kaneko09Humanoids}  can evaluate the effect of load reduction
quantitatively by estimating motor torque \cite{Miura13ICRA}, taking
an example of a supportive wear called ``Smart Suit Lite''
\cite{Tanaka11JRM} designed to reduce load
at the lower back with embedded elastic bands.

The important issue in those applications is how to generate natural
motions of a humanoid robot.  There have been a number of studies on
``motion retargeting'' techniques in order to generate humanoid
motions based on those of a human measured by a motion capture system.
Retargeting captured motion to humanoids has been actively studied
during the last decade, thanks to the progress of their dynamic
capability. The work of Pollard \cite{Pollard02ICRA} is one of the
pioneering studies that enable reproduction of human motions by a
humanoid, in this case the upper body of Sarcos humanoid robot, by
taking into account various constraints.  Nakaoka et al. developed a
technique to transfer Japanese traditional dancing motions to a
humanoid by introducing a notion of leg task model
\cite{nakaoka_icra2004,nakaoka_2007}.  Miura et al. \cite{Miura11IROS}
devised a walking pattern generator that allows the humanoid robot
HRP-4C to walk in a manner extremely close to humans, including
stretched knees, swing-leg trajectory and single support phase on the
toe.  Other imitation methods have been proposed based on a dynamic
controller \cite{Yamane11humanoids,Ramos11humanoids}, motion
recognition and primitives \cite{Ott08humanoids} and extraction of
upper-body motion from markerless motion input
\cite{Dariush08IROS,Do08humanoids}.

\end{figure*}


On the other hand, motion retargeting has been investigated
intensively in computer graphics domain, typically to generate motions
for new characters based on motion capture data using space-time
constraints solver \cite{Gleicher98}.  Recently, Ho et al. proposed a
new retargeting method called ``interaction mesh'' that preserves the
spatial relationship between closely interacting body parts and
objects in the environments \cite{Komura10}.  Nakaoka and Komura
extended this method for retargeting to a humanoid robot by taking
advantage of its capacity to adapt motions to a character with highly
different physical properties \cite{Nakaoka12Humanoids}. Usage of
interaction mesh brings natural following of original human motion and
self-collision avoidance.  Although this method includes 
balance consideration by shifting the waist, this approach remains
specific instead of general whole-body motion optimization and 
does not deal with dynamic constraints such as torque limits. 
In addition, those constraints are treated separately after
generating retargeted motion to adapt to the humanoid.


% Optim
Another related domain is the optimization technique that is more and
more employed to generate robot trajectories minimizing certain cost
function under mechanical or dynamic constraints. Miossec et
al. applied nonlinear optimization to dynamic whole-body motion like a
kicking motion of a human-size humanoid \cite{Miossec06ROBIO}.
Recently the optimization is utilized for generation of multi-contact
dynamic motion through modeling of dynamic constraints using Taylor
expansion \cite{Lengagne13IJRR}. 
For dynamic trajectory optimization for digital human, an efficient algorithm
has been proposed \cite{Todorov2012IROS-online,Todorov2012IROS-contact}.
Suleiman et al. proposed another
trajectory optimization technique based on Lie algebra that allows
efficient computation through analytic integration of dynamics
\cite{Suleiman07Humanoids} and applied it to human motion imitation
\cite{Suleiman08ICRA}.  The latter research aims at optimizing the
humanoid trajectory to be as close as human motion, but self-collision
avoidance is incorporated as a post-processing to the optimized motion
like previous work \cite{Nakaoka12Humanoids}. This is disadvantageous
because separate application of collision avoidance may lead to
unnatural motions.



% Motivation and contributions
% Problem: dynamic constraints not well considered
% To our knowledge, there has been no motion optimization integrating
% motion retargeting and self-collision or interaction with
% environment at the same time.
Methods in previous research are, therefore, still lacking the
capability to optimize humanoid motions by taking into account
the associated problems for retargeting in a unified manner.
The main contribution of the paper is the optimization process
integrating retargeting, dynamics constraints and self-collision at
the same time, 
in order to create the humanoid motion as close to human motions as
possible. 
In this paper, we address this retargeting by formulating it
as a nonlinear optimization problem under spatial and dynamic
constraints.
%Our contributions are...
% the introduction of a two steps optimization process allowing to
% adapt motion to any humanoid shaped robots. 
First, the captured motion is pre-processed to provide better initial
guess for the optimization.
% Once the link length are resized to match the targeted robot morphology, 
Then the full optimization problem is solved
considering the spatial relationship and dynamic robotic constraints
simultaneously.  
The spatial relationship between body parts of captured motion is
reserved by using interaction mesh as introduced by \cite{Komura10},
which achieves self-collision avoidance in consequence. 
% In contrast to previous work including post-processing of the

\section{Method Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The proposed retargeting framework consists of three steps as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:algorithm} and  
takes a time series of captured marker positions to
generate a retargeted robot joint trajectory.  
The main part of the retargeting is the second step, which is the main
optimization process whereas the first and last steps are additional
data processing for efficient optimization and motion conversion
respectively. 

The first pre-processing takes care of initial guess for the
optimization. It takes care of retargeting problem only to fit the
marker positions to the target robot structure, to obtain the initial
state that helps the optimization process converge quickly.
% without integrating any robotics consideration (motion balance or
% torque constraints). 
This geometric problem can be represented as a
linear problem using the interaction mesh \cite{Komura10}
with a quadratic cost rendering its resolution
extremely efficient.

The main optimization process is initialized using the result of the 
first step and then takes the full problem into consideration. 
This optimization incorporates robotic constraints such as
motion balance and torque constraints together with the spatial
relationship modeled also by interaction mesh.
The previous work \cite{Nakaoka12Humanoids} adopts a two-step approach
for this optimization:
first the markers were optimized before adapting the motion by
optimizing joint angles for the robot in order to satisfy robotic
constraints.  
In contrast, in the proposed method the
optimization variables are the marker position throughout the
retargeting process until it is converted to joint angles at the last
step.
This is advantageous to make the constraint matrix sparse \cite{Komura10}
and also to maintain a global optimization framework
unifying all the constraints simultaneously. 
% Until the second step, the optimization is applied to the positions of
% marker sets, which is the spatial coordinates of points on the body parts.
% In our case, to preserve a global framework only the marker position is
% optimized along the process. On the opposite, 
Inverse  kinematics computation of the target robot is employed in
order to estimate the nearest robot configuration from the marker positions
at each time step. 
This allows evaluating robotic constraints such as dynamic balance or
joint torque limit by using deduced joint velocity and acceleration.
The robotic constraints being non-linear, this main
optimization problem is much more computationally intensive.

The third post-processing step is conversion of the resultant marker
positions into the robot joint configurations that is done in a
straightforward manner using inverse kinematics.  


\section{Optimization-based Retargeting Method}
\label{sec:retargeting}

% \subsection{Modeling}
As described in the previous section, our retargeting method has two
main components: motion retargeting and robotic motion generation that
are integrated in the optimization. This section will detail
their computational aspects.

\subsection{Motion retargeting}


The retargeting algorithm employed in the first two steps in the
framework of Fig.~\ref{fig:algorithm} relies on 
%The retargeting has been described extensively
% \cite{Nakaoka12Humanoids}. It relies on 
the notion of ``interaction mesh'' to ensure that   
spatial relationship between bodies is preserved. 
We will briefly describe how it is incorporated in the optimization
based on previous work by Ho et al \cite{Komura10}. 

By applying Delaunay Tetrahedralization \cite{Si2005} on the marker
set, one can generate a mesh which is parameterized by the marker
positions $\mathbf{V}_i = (\mathbf{p}^i_1 \cdots \mathbf{p}^i_m)$
where $1 \leq i \leq n$. $n$ denotes here the number of frame
composing the motion and $m$ the number of markers in each
frame. $\mathbf{p}^i_1$ represents the position of the first marker in
the $i$-th frame.

Given a particular interaction mesh, one can compute the ``Laplacian
Coordinate'' of one marker as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:laplacian-coordinate}
L(p^i_j) = \mathbf{p}_i^j - \sum_{l \in N_j} w^j_l \mathbf{p}^i_l
\end{equation}

In Eq.~(\ref{eq:laplacian-coordinate}), $N_j$ is the one-hop
neighborhood of the marker $j$ in the interaction mesh and $w^j_l$ is the
weight of the marker $l$ when computing the Laplacian Coordinate of
marker $j$. This weight is inversely proportional to the distance
between $j$ and $l$.

Considering these two notions, it is possible to introduce the
``Laplacian Deformation Energy'' associated to a marker set which
serve as a cost function in this problem:

\begin{equation}
E_L(\mathbf{V'}_i) = \sum_j || L(\mathbf{p}^i_j) - L(\mathbf{p}^i_j{}') ||^2
\end{equation}

The Laplacian Deformation Energy is the square of the norm of the
difference between the Laplacian Coordinates of the original marker
set and the updated marker set $\mathbf{V}'_i = (\mathbf{p}^i_1 \cdots
\mathbf{p}^i_m)$.

In practice, this cost function penalizes motion of highly-connected
markers whereas isolated ones will move for a lower cost.

% Talk about acceleration penalty?

A second cost function is added to the first one to smooth the
motion. To achieve this goal, the marker set acceleration energy is
considered:

\begin{equation}
  E_A(\mathbf{V}_{i-1}', \mathbf{V}_{i}', \mathbf{V}_{i+1}') =
  \frac{1}{2} || \mathbf{V}_{i-1}' - 2 \mathbf{V}_{i}' + \mathbf{V}_{i+1}' ||^2
\end{equation}

$\mathbf{V}_{i-1}'$, $\mathbf{V}_{i}'$, $\mathbf{V}_{i+1}'$ being the
new marker set position for the frame $i - 1$, $i$ and $i +
1$. Acceleration energy is always null for first and last frame.

The final cost function $C$ is by consequence expressed by:

\begin{equation}
    C(\mathbf{V}_{i-1}', \mathbf{V}_{i}', \mathbf{V}_{i+1}') =
    E_L(\mathbf{V}_{i}') + \alpha E_A(\mathbf{V}_{i-1}',
    \mathbf{V}_{i}', \mathbf{V}_{i+1}') 
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the weighting coefficient.
Additionally, a link length constraint is defined. This constraint
aims at retargeting the motion so that it fits the robot
morphology. It is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
|| \mathbf{p}^1_e - \mathbf{p}^2_e ||^2 = l_e
\end{equation}


Whenever there is a need for some part of the robot body to stay
fixed, an optional positional constraint is also provided through an
equality constraint:

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{V}_i' = \mathbf{P}_i
\end{equation}

With $0 \leq i \leq m$.

% FIXME: sparse matrices are used -> constraints and cost function
% Jacobian mostly empty. See
% http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/tkomura/SIGGRAPH10_preprint.pdf


The quadratic problem is then solved to generate a new set of marker
positions. 
The goal of the first pre-processing step in Fig.~\ref{fig:algorithm}
is to obtain the 
marker positions that fit the robot structure sufficiently well.
Of course, the resulting motion may still not be feasible due to
physical constraints.
The output marker positions from the pre-processing is used as the
initial guess for the main optimization process considering robotic
constraints and retargeting at the same time, as explained in the next
subsection. 

% This set of marker position is now fitting the robot
% structure well after the first pre-processing step.
% However, the motion may still not be feasible due to physical
% constraints. 
% Therefore, this process is not enough to generate a
% feasible robotics motion. The next section will show how to refine
% this motion to ensure that physical constraints are respected.


\subsection{Robotics motion generation}


%From the motion generated in the previous section, 
We here define a non-linear optimization problem using the motion
derived with the pre-processing. 
The same optimization variables, namely the set of marker positions,
are used also with the cost function and the constraints introduced in
the previous section.
% than the first one,
%the same cost function and the same link length and positional
%constraints.
By keeping the previous constraints, one can make sure that the good
properties ensured by the previous pre-processing are kept during this
optimization step.
Moreover, the constraint matrix can be kept sparse by 
using the marker positions as optimization variables 
\cite{Komura10}, which makes the optimization computation efficient,
whereas the joint Jacobian matrix for the robot is dense.

To ensure that the motion is feasible by the robot, two
additional constraints are added in the main optimization process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic balance constraint.
\item Joint angle, velocity and torque constraints.
\end{itemize}

We here need robot configuration $\mathbf{q}$ from the marker
positions to calculate the following constraints with dynamic property
like mass and moment of inertia of each link.
Since the output marker positions from the pre-processing are close
enough to the feasible robot configuration, we can benefit from the
joint angle fitting using damped least square method introduced in
\cite{Nakaoka12Humanoids}. 
Once the robot configurations are obtained, the following 
constraints are evaluated on the numerical basis, by using
joint velocity and acceleration computed with finite difference.
 
The first constraint constrains the ZMP (zero moment point) position
so that it stays into the robot support polygon:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    x_{ZMP} &=& x_G - \frac{\dot{\sigma}_y\ +\ m\ z_G\ \ddot{x}_G}{m\ (\ddot{z}_G + g)} \\
    y_{ZMP} &=& y_G + \frac{\dot{\sigma}_x\ -\ m\ z_G\ \ddot{y}_G}{m\ (\ddot{z}_G + g)}
    \end{array}
\label{eq:zmp}
\end{equation}
where $(x_{ZMP}, y_{ZMP})$ is the ZMP position on the
ground, $\dot{\sigma}$ the variation of the kinetic momentum around
the center of mass, and $(x_G, y_G, z_G)$ the center of mass
position. The gravitational constant is denoted by $g$.
Here we assume that the robot is moving on a flat floor.
The ZMP acts as a criterion that allows deciding whether a motion can be
executed stably or not. As long as it stays inside the convex hull of the
robot contact points with the floor, the motion is dynamically stable.
Knowing which foot of the robot is in contact with the floor and the
foot geometry, it is possible to insert this  as an
inequality constraint
\begin{equation}
  (x_{ZMP}, y_{ZMP}) \subset {\cal S}(x_{rfoot}, y_{lfoot})
  \label{eq:support}
\end{equation}
to make sure that the ZMP is staying inside the current support
polygon, denoted by ${\cal S}(x_{rfoot}, y_{lfoot})$ that is
determined by the right and left positions $(x_{rfoot}, y_{lfoot})$. 

The second robotic constraint we take into account in this problem
is the joint limitations. Given $(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}},
\ddot{\mathbf{q}})$, % the dynamics algorithm,  % \cite{FIXME} 
%for example using the method presented in \cite{Featherstone2008}
the set of torques  $\mathbf{\tau} = (\tau_1, \cdots, \tau_o)$
applied to each robot joint can be computed using the classical
equation of motion: 

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{q}) \ddot{\mathbf{q}} + \mathbf{C}(\mathbf{q},
  \dot{\mathbf{q}}) + \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{\tau}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{q})$ is the system mass matrix,
$\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}})$ is the vector of Coriolis
and centrifugal forces and $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q})$ the vector of
gravitational forces.
Other robotic constraints for limits of joint rotation, velocity and
torque are expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    \mathbf{q}_{min} \leq \mathbf{q} \leq \mathbf{q}_{max} \\
    \mathbf{dq}_{min} \leq \dot{\mathbf{q}} \leq \mathbf{dq}_{max} \\
    \mathbf{\tau}_{min} \leq \mathbf{\tau} \leq \mathbf{\tau}_{max} \\
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

% post-process
As mentioned earlier, the output of the main optimization process is
the set of marker positions. As we have already applied the robotic
constraints, the resultant motion can be easily converted to the 
joint trajectory to be executed by the robot through inverse
kinematics.

\section{Implementation of the optimization problem using RobOptim}
\label{sec:implementation}

% sparse
RobOptim is a general framework to assist the development and resolution of
optimization problems applied to robotics. 
The optimization is more and more applied to robotics field to solve
complex problems of motion planning and generation with many
constraints, as mentioned earlier.
Although number of state-of-the-art optimization solver tools and
libraries are now available, they are not necessarily ready for
immediate use for robotics.

RobOptim has been developed to allow roboticists to prototype their
optimization applications easily by providing necessary interfaces
specific to robotic problems in the form of C++ libraries.
It has a three-layer
architecture: the core, the solver and the application layers.
The core layer provides a way to define mathematical
function and their associated derivatives, while the solver layer encapsulates
different state-of-the-art solvers so that they can solve problems
defined using the representation proposed by the core layer. 
The application layer contains dedicated mathematical functions which
can be embedded into different optimization problems. An overview of
the framework architecture is shown in Fig.~(\ref{fig:roboptim}).

\begin{figure}[b]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure/roboptim-architecture.pdf}
  \caption{RobOptim  architecture.}
  \label{fig:roboptim}
\end{figure}

The core layer offers some useful higher-level tools that help users
define the functions such as costs and constraints introduced in the
previous section.  
By implementing those functions inherited from the basic
mathematical functions of the core layer,  RobOptim ensures the
compatibility with a number of state-of-the-art solvers whose plug-ins
are provided in the solver layer.
Those tools include function definition itself and also
differentiation of the functions that can be computed analytically, or numerically 
when no analytical gradient is provided by the user. Even if the
gradient is provided, numerical differentiation can be used to ensure
the computation correctness.
The user can benefit from the transparency of those higher level
tools to prototype their problem
without thinking about individual solvers used for optimization.
% The interest of adopting such a framework is to take advantage of
% higher level tools such as 
% numerical differentiation, which can be used 

Although not really utilized in our problem of retargeting, the
application layer is convenient especially for planning purpose.
One of the practical tools is the trajectory toolbox,
which allows representation of robot motion using B-spline. Since
these are associated with mathematical functions of the core layer and
others like of minimal-time optimization.


RobOptim is distributed as an open-source library (\mbox{LGPL-3}) through its
website: http://www.roboptim.net/

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented a unified approach combining retargeting and
robotics constraints into one single nonlinear optimization
problem.
For efficient computation, a three-step approach is adopted including
pre- and post-processing of the motion.
%To enhance convergence speed, an initial process solving only
%the geometrical part of the problem as a quadratic problem. 
After obtaining pre-processed marker positions approximately fitted to
the robot structure, the main optimization process generates 
also marker motions that respect the original spatial relationship of body
parts as much as possible based on interaction mesh, by satisfying the
robotic dynamic constraints throughout the motion.
The optimization output motion can be converted to the robot trajectory
in a straightforward manner by the last step.
The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by
simulating the generated robot motion.

Future work includes extensions to take into account different cost
functions such as human-likeliness, or additional constraints such
as collision avoidance or other .
Application to walking motion retargeting will also be addressed in
future work.

% \addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
